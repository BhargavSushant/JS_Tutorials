## Recommendations

- ✅ Start small but complete each project.
- ✅ Refactor code after first version.
- ✅ Add new features to each project as you grow (e.g., sorting, filtering, saving, themes).
- ✅ Build a portfolio site to showcase them.
- ✅ Gradually learn tooling (Parcel, Vite, Prettier, Linting).
